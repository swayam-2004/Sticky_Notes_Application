# 📝 Sticky Note Application

This is a simple **Sticky Note Application** built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The app allows users to create, edit, save, and delete virtual sticky notes right in the browser.

## 🧠 How It Works

- All saved notes are reloaded on page refresh using Local Storage.
